I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to joining NUS, I completed my PhD at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I was advised by [Prof. Cheng Li](https://mr-cheng-li.github.io/). I also earned my bachelor's degree from USTC. During my PhD, I was fortunate to work with Prof. Cheng Li at USTC, Prof. Xiaosong Ma at MBZUAI, Yingqiang Zhang, Hao Chen, Feifei Li, and other brilliant collaborators from Alibaba.

My research interests include distributed databases, resource disaggregation, and AI systems.
